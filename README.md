## Overview

Features

- realistic hydrodyanmics simulations from the famous paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games, Stem 2003](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Real-Time-Fluid-Dynamics-for-Games-Stam/5127ac7b58e36ffd13ca4437fc123c6a018dc436?p2df)
- runs both on laptop browser and in VR browser
- served in Python, written in ClojureScript

You can find in profiling.md some measurements around speed and efficiency of the simulation.

## Clojure Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    npm install
    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).

To run tests (you need to have `node` installed)

    lein doo node test

## Python Setup

With `figwheel` running, set up your venv with `flask` and run 

	python python-server/server.py
